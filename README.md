## Overview
pyGSM (Python + GSM) combines the powerful tools of python with the
Growing String Method to allow for rapid prototyping and improved
readability.

pyGSM utilizes OpenBabel/Pybel for internal coordinates,
Numpy for matrix operations and various other tools and datatypes
such as Itertools and tuples. 

pyGSM also takes advantage of object oriented programming to make
the different Electronic Structure theory packages
QChem, Molpro, PyTC work seemlessly under the hood.
