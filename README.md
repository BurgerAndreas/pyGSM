## Overview
pyGSM (Python + GSM) combines the powerful tools of python with the
Growing String Method to allow for rapid prototyping and readability.

Specifically, pyGSM utilizes OpenBabel/Pybel for internal coordinates
and printing utilities, Numpy for matrix operations and various other 
tools and datatypes such as Itertools and tuples.
