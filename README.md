## Overview
pyGSM (Python + GSM) combines the powerful tools of python with the
Growing String Method to allow for rapid prototyping and improved
readability.

Specifically, pyGSM utilizes OpenBabel/Pybel for internal coordinates,
Numpy for matrix operations and various other tools and datatypes
such as Itertools and tuples.
